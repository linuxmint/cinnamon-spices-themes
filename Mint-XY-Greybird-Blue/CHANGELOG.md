## Change Log

##### 1.06
- Removed fixed sizes for entries inside menus. This was causing me infinite headaches while developing an applet. The fixed width didn't allowed me to use *set_width*. And the fixed height destroyed the entry capability to expand on word wrapping and on multi-line text.
- Added LICENSE file.

##### 1.05
- Fixed some warning messages generated by undefined -gradient-end/-gradient-start properties.
- Added more fixes for Cinnamon 3.2.x compatibility (from upstream).

##### 1.04
- Added support for Cinnamon 3.2.x.

##### 1.03
- Tweaks to the about dialogs (for Cinnamon applets/desklets).
