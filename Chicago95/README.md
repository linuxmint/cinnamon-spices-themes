I was unhappy with the various XFCE/GTK2/GTK3 Windows 95 based themes and decided to make one that was more consistent across the board for theming.

### Included in this theme:

- Icons to complete the icon theme started with Classic95
- GTK2 and GTK3 themes
- Edited Redmond XFWM theme to more accurately reflect Windows 95
- Chicago95 Plus! A tool to preview and install Windows 95/98/ME/XP themes
- Plymouth theme created from scratch
- An MS-DOS inspired theme for oh-my-zsh
- Partial support for HiDPI monitors
- Partial icon theme for LibreOffice 6+

### Requirements:

- GTK+ 3.22 or 3.24
- Xfce 4.12, 4.14, 4.16
- gtk2-engines-pixbuf (Recommended for GTK2 applications)
- The xfce4-panel-profiles package
- A Window compositor

(If your are using an older desktop that uses GTK3.18, you can use [this forked version of the theme.](https://github.com/EMH-Mark-I/Chicago95-Custom-XUbuntu-16.04-))
