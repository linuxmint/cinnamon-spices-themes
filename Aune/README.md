## Aune

Version: 1.3

Theme supports cinnamon.

Aune is a transparent theme. The color has been changed from black to a slightly brown. A 3px gap has been added between the panel and the menu. Rounded corners. The text brightens slightly when hovered over.

The goal is to make transparency work well with different background images. Currently, a light background image works better.

The theme is named after my grandmother.

## Installation

Most easily installed via Cinnamon's Themes module in Cinnamon settings.
