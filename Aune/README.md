## Aune

Version: 11.1.2026

Theme supports cinnamon.

Aune is a transparent theme. The color has been changed from black to slightly brown. A 3px gap has been added between the panel and the menu. The menu is also off the edge. Works beautifully on the left edge and at the top. The panel on the right and bottom is attached to the edge, but I'll think about that later. 

The transparency may be too high on some monitors. I have tested colors on three different monitor manufacturers (HP, Samsung, Aoc). It is a little different on all of them. The goal has been to get the color and transparency so that it works with different background images.

The theme is named after my grandmother.

## Installation

Most easily installed via Cinnamon's Themes module in Cinnamon settings.
