# Soul Cinnamon Theme

A Cinnamon DE theme with focus on consistency, adaptiveness, efficiency, and a modern look.

Open for contributions (consider sending requests basing from it's [source code in sass](https://github.com/anaximeno/soul-cinnamon-theme), instead of directly changing the css artifact produced by it), just keep in mind the points above (for example regarding efficiency, using many heavy effects like box shadow or blur aren't advised since it makes the theme more resource intensive), plus make sure to take in account UX aspects for the theming.

Also the main source of truth regarding the most important theme components should be https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/tree/master/data/theme.
