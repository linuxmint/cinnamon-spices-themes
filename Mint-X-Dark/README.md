# Mint-X-Dark theme for Cinnamon

This is a "no frills" Mint-X theme adjusted for Dark Mode.

No frills meaning that it resembles the default Mint-X theme as close as possible but without any extras added, just a plain dark mode Mint-X theme!


## Installation

Download the zip file and extract the `Mint-X-Dark` folder into your `~/.themes` directory.


## Compatibility

Tested and developed in Cinnamon `6.4.6`.

## Font

The default font is `Noto Sans` as in the Mint-X.

To change the font, edit the `cinnamon.css` file at selector `stage`
(beginning of file).
