# Mint-Yz: The New Colors of a New Era (Gtk theme)
The interface of all your software and the entire desktop is now rejuvenated, modernized. Your Linux Mint **Mint-Y** theme now comes in more energized and readable colors.

And all of this is done on a solid foundation of improved shell and python programs. It is also renamed **Mint-Yz** and is a separate package. This means you can install it in addition to the standard Mint-Y, compare, experiment, and change your mind at any time. Your good old Mint-Y will not be removed or changed. And all of this is made very easy, see the installation instructions below.

## Installation
First, check your system is not too old for this theme to work properly. This theme works well on Linux Mint 19, Linux Mint 20, and newer versions. (Gtk+ 3.22 or newer)

There are two installation methods to choose from:

1. You can **install** via Cinnamon's **Menu > Preferences > Themes > Add/Remove.**

1. Or you can also **install** by downloading from [Cinnamon Spices](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes) and then unzip into your (hidden) **~/.themes** directory. You may need to press Ctrl+H to see this otherwise hidden directory.

Next:

* Option: For better consistency, you could allow the themes to apply to all the users as well as on the login window and all the GUI apps running as root. For this you can run this command in your terminal after installation to move all the files to the system theme directory: ``sudo mv ~/.themes/Mint-Yz-* /usr/share/themes``

* Select the themes as your Controls, Desktop and Window Borders in **Menu > Preferences > Themes**

## Carefully chosen colors and precise engineering
This theme is the sum of a lot of work. Are you curious? You can take a look at the source on [https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme](https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme) (colors branch). At the start of all this there was the Horst3180 Arc-theme. On this well-designed and solid foundation was created the Mint-Y theme, which has evolved considerably since. Then I created a fork of this Mint-Y and made some improvements on my auto branch, to get the build process 100% automated. And finally, this colors branch was created on top of all that.

The colors convey energies, vibrations... They should not be too subdued. But they should not be set at full saturation and brightness either, because this could cause eye strain. So the saturation and lightness levels are carefully chosen here. And there is also the contrast with the white text in the foreground which received sustained attention. So these new colors here are not just nicer when compared with the old ones. They are nice, energized, driving, and more contrasted, thus more readable.

## Compare
Be aware that our eyes appreciate colors by comparison. When compared with the old ones, these new colors look much more saturated, vibrant. But then compare them with some fully saturated and bright colors and you will see these new Mint-Yz colors are somewhat subdued, but just not as much as the old ones. You can see this in [Mint-Y-Colors/compare](https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-themes/tree/colors/Mint-Y-Colors/compare). So i hope you will find these new colors are just well balanced.

Of course, not all colors are treated equally. There is no way you can make a seriously subdued orange without making it turn into some altered, brownish color. But if this orange looks too energized to your taste, just switch to another color! You have plenty of choice here. And if you are still unsure, you can always go back to the old colors. This new set is called **Mint-Yz** and gets installed alongside the old **Mint-Y,** letting you choose between the old and the new.
